# Fulcrum Catfish Plugin

There are several tools that each website needs such as social share buttons and quick links.  This plugin creates a catfish, i.e. a sticky footer toolbar.  When a viewer visits a single page and scrolls down (meaning s/he is reading your article), the catfish will slide up providing the features s/he needs to quickly navigate and share the article.

This is a WordPress plugin and [Fulcrum](https://github.com/hellofromtonya/fulcrum) addon.

## Features

1. Adds a sticky footer to the bottom right corner of the website
2. Facebook and Twitter social share links (configurable in the config file)
3. Quick link to the comments form
4. Quick link to read the comments
5. Quick link to scroll to the top of the page

## Installation

1. Install the [Fulcrum](https://github.com/hellofromtonya/fulcrum), the central custom repository plugin for WordPress.
2. Then you can install this plugin.

Installation from GitHub is as simple as cloning the repo onto your local machine.  To clone the repo, do the following:

1. Using PhpStorm, open your project and navigate to `wp-content/plugins/`. (Or open terminal and navigate there).
2. Then type: `git clone https://github.com/hellofromtonya/catfish`.

## Configuration

Everything is configurable using the configuration files found in the `config` folder.

### Styling

Oh silly, styling never goes in a plugin. Nope, you want to style this baby up in your theme.  To see a sample, head over and take a look at my [Hello child theme](https://github.com/hellofromtonya/hello-child-theme/tree/master/assets/sass/components/catfish).
